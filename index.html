        The Magnus effect is named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus and applies to
        spherical/cylindrical objects moving through a fluid. It plays a role in multiple
        sports and also the aviation and marine industries.

        The magnus effect is the phenomenon that causes a rotating spherical object to curve
        while travelling through fluids such as air. The effect is much less prominent
        in water as the larger resistance caused by water means objects can’t travel
        as fast and will not be as useful. It has many uses in multiple different
        sports, plus the marine and aviation industries, which will be explained in
        this article along with the physics behind the effect itself.

        How it works:

        The Magnus effect is a physical phenomenon that causes the trajectory of a
        spinning object in a fluid to alternate. A mixture of different effects makes
        it up, including the Bernoulli effect. It is named after German physicist
        Heinrich Gustav Magnus who discovered it in 1852 to explain why spinning
        bullets would alter course in mid-air. An object that rotates and moves
        quickly creates a vortex of air around it. This in turn creates e pressure
        difference on either side of the object. On one side, the air moves in the
        same direction, while moving in the opposite direction on the other side.
        Air pressure is now much less than atmospheric pressure and a force acts
        perpendicular to the direction of motion. This is very similar to an airfoil
        in laminar air flow. The Magnus effect also works in water but to much less
        effect thanks to the higher resistance and density of water compared to air.

        Uses:
        
        The magnus effect proves to be very useful in many sports such as football, tennis,
        golf, baseball and cricket for examples. It also plays an important role in some
        aspects of the aviation industry and marine industry.

        Uses in Sport:
        
        In football, it is particularly useful in dead ball situations such as free kicks
        and corners. The Magnus effect causes the flight of the ball to change, potentially
        throwing off the opposing goalkeeper on free kicks or defenders on corners. The
        effect is what causes the ball to curve around the wall or dip over the wall on a
        free kick. It can also cause the ball to wobble and move unexpectedly in the air, 
        called a knuckleball free kick. The effect also causes the ball to move towards or
        away from the goal on an inswinging or outswinging corner, causing problems for the
        goalkeeper and defenders. This is very important as set pieces (dead ball situations)
        can be very influential to decide the outcome of a match. The effect can also be used
        to make passes to teammates that are just out of reach if defenders. The ball will
        curve past the defender and land at the feet of a teammate in a perfect scenario.
        
        In tennis, it is essential in applying spin to the ball in the hope of wrong footing
        the opposing player and winning a point. Or, it could be used so that the ball curves
        out of reach of the opposing player unexpectedly. 
        
        In golf, it can be used to attempt to avoid obstacles such as trees and still send
        the golf ball on course towards the green. This could save the golfer from having
        to take extra shots to stay clear of obstacles and therefore help them towards
        victory. It could also be used to add backspin and prevent the ball from rolling
        too far on a chip. 
        
        In baseball, the Magnus effect can be used when pitching the ball. Pitchers will
        apply spin to the ball in the hope that the batter will swing and miss the ball and
        will be struck out. The movement of the ball can cause the batter to misjudge the
        trajectory of it. There are many different variations of spin that can be applied,
        such as curveballs and sliders, and these decide which direction the ball will move
        towards while travelling from the pitcher to the batter. This is used most
        effectively by professional pitchers in order to strike out the opposing teams
        strongest batters and prevent them from winning home runs.
        
        In cricket, the uses of the Magnus effect are very similar to baseball as the aim
        is to apply spin to the ball in order to make the batter miss the ball. If the ball
        bounces past the batter and hits the stumps then the batter is ruled out and can
        no longer partake in that round of batting. 

        Uses in Aviation and Marine industries:
        
        Some ships are built with Flettner rotors that utilise the magnus effect to generate
        lift when the wind blows past them. They are large vertical cylinders that cannot
        work alone to power the ship but can reduce energy consumption when paired with some
        other means of propulsion. <a href="https://northsearegion.eu/wasp/our-technologies/flettner-rotor-eco-flettner/how-it-works-flettner-rotor/index.html">How Flettner rotors work.</a>
        
        The magnus effect hasn’t been as influential in aviation. In the 1920’s, Anton
        Flettner attempted to build a cyclogyro, which was essentially an aeroplane but
        instead of wings it had horizontal cylinders, very similar to those used on ships.
        Unfortunately, even though some prototypes were built, this idea never came to
        fruition as the cyclogyro had power loss issues and lift failures.
