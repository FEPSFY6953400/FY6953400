        The magnus effect is the phenomenon that causes a rotating sphere to curve
        while travelling through fluids such as air. The effect is much less prominent
        in water as the larger resistance caused by water means the object cant travel
        as fast and will not be as useful. It has many uses in multiple different sports
        which will be explained in this article along with the physics behind the effect itself.

        How it works: 
        The rotation of a sphere causes air to flow faster around one side of it. This in
        turn causes the sphere to change trajectory in midair and gives the spin effect seen
        in many sports. 


        Uses in Sport:
        The magnus effect proves to be very useful in many sports such as football, tennis,
        golf, baseball and cricket for examples. 
        In football, it is particularly useful in dead ball situations such as free kicks
        and corners. The magnus effect causes the flight of the ball to change, potentially
        throwing off the opposing goalkeeper on free kicks or defenders on corners. The
        effect is what causes the ball to curve around the wall or dip over the wall on a
        free kick. It can also cause the ball to wobble and move unexpectedly in the air, 
        called a knuckleballfree kick. The effect also causes the ball to move towards or
        away from the goal on an inswinging or outswinging corner, causing problems for the
        goalkeeper and defenders. This is very important as set pieces (dead ball situations)
        can be very influential to decide the outcome of a match. The effect can also be used
        to make passes to teammates that are just out of reach if defenders. The ball will
        curve past the defender and land at the feet of a teammate in a perfect scenario. 
        In tennis, it is essential in applying spin to the ball in the hope of wrong footing
        the opposing player and winning a point. Or, it could be used so that the ball curves
        out of reach of the opposing player unexpectedly. 
        In golf, it can be used to attempt to avoid obstacles such as trees and still send
        the golf ball on course towards the green. This could save the golfer from having
        to take extra shots to stay clear of obstacles and therefore help them towards
        victory. It could also be used to add backspin and prevent the ball from rolling
        too far on a chip. 
        In baseball, the magnus effect can be used when pitching the ball. Pitchers will
        apply spin to the ball in the hope that the batter will swing and miss the ball and
        will be struck out. The movement of the ball can cause the batter to misjudge the
        trajectory of it. There are many different variations of spin that can be applied
        and these decide which direction the ball will move towards while travelling from
        the pitcher to the batter. This is used most effectively by professional pitchers
        in order to strike out the opposing teams strongest batters and prevent them from
        winning home runs.
        In cricket, the uses of the magnus effect are very similar to baseball as the aim
        is to apply spin to the ball in order to make the batter miss the ball. If the ball
        bounces past the batter and hits the stumps then the batter is ruled out and can
        no longer partake in that round of batting.
